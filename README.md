# **Introduction** üåü

3D building classification is the computational process of categorizing three-dimensional representations of architectural structures. This involves analyzing volumetric data to percieve distinct architectural features,spatial configurations,and other instrinisc characterstics of buildings. 

We've developed a methodology that intergrates a generative capabilities with classification strengths. At the core of our approach is a hierarchical latent space that captures features of 3D building structures. This representation is then subjected to a diffusion process ,which perturbs the data iteratively. Post-diffusion, a deep neural network is employed to denoise the data, extracting essential features that are crucial for classification.  

Following the denoising, a classification model is introduced which predicts the building category based on the denoised latent representation. Our system is designed to handle multi-modal data, allowing it to process and integrate information from various data types, enhancing its classification accuracy. 

# Features 


# Approach üîç

Our project intergrates the capabilities of LION, a generative model adept at producing detailed 3D shapes,with the strengths of a diffusion classifier for zero-shot classification. By harnessing LION's ability to generate diverse 3D shapes and feeding them to the diffusion classifier, we achieve nuanced categorization of 3D builings. 

  * **Hierarchical Latent Space** :- At the core, we utilize LION's hieratchical latent space. 3D point cloud is encode in to a dual-layered latent representation and a point-structured latent space. This ensures a comprehensive capture of both macto and micro features of 3D building structures. 

  * **Diffusion Process** :- After the encoding phase, the data is subjected to a diffusion process. This action iteratively introduces disturbances to the data,setting the stage for the upcoming denosing step. 

  * **Denoising & Classification** :- A deep neural network is trained to denoise the disrupted data. After this step, a classification component, conditioned on class labels determines the building's category by assessing which diffusion class most accurately corresponds to the introduced nose. 

  * **Multi-modal Intergration** :- Our model harnesses the power of multi modal machine learning, seamlessly intergrating diverse data modalities - 3D point cloud data, textual descriptions, 2D images to offer a comprehensive approach to 3D building classification. 
  
# Data Source üìä

For this project, we used the dataset provided by the BuildingNet Challenge, available on [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevg7fWWMYYMd1vaOdDloUX_55VOQK7PqS1DlniFV7_vuoI0w/viewform). To access the dataset, you are required to fill out a specific form. This dataset is a collection of 3D building structures, which serves as the foundation for our diffusion 3D building classification model.
